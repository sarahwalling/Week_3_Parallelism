As we discussed in class on Tuesday, model parallelism involves splitting up a network between processors such that different portions of the same layer might be computed on different processors. Knowing that the example network is comprised of two full-connected layers, what changes would you have to make to the code to be able to employ model parallelism.

After using this data to compute the feed forward and backpropogation gradients, then should be sent out again to whatever part of the distributed environment will compute the new weights and biases from that collection of data.\n",

Pipeline parallelism would be easier, because it can be directly parallelized - you don't have to change the code to parallelize it, the feed forward and backpropogation computations would just be done on separate processors. i.e., compute A1, send to next processor, compute Z1, send forward, etc all the way through the feed forward function. \n",
